With point and click issue reporting, tracking bugs was never easier. Screenshots, screen recordings, and the used browser version, as well as a lot of additional information, help you to solve every web issue faster. No endless bug reporting forms for your users. A small snippet of code on the website creates a feedback button. Your users may highlight, blackout and use sticky notes to give visual feedback which is then sent to you!
